Ramp CTF React App

This project fetches the Ramp challenge page, reconstructs the hidden URL
from the DOM pattern, fetches the hidden URL to retrieve the flag, and
animates the flag characters as list items (typewriter effect, 500ms per char).

How to use:
1. Upload this ZIP to CodeSandbox (Import Project -> Upload ZIP).
2. Start the sandbox and wait for the app to load. It will show Loading...
   then render the flag characters one by one.

Flag (captured separately): bonfire
